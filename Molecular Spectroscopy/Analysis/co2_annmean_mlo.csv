# USE OF NOAA GML DATA,,,,,
#,,,,,
# These data are made freely available to the public and the,,,,,
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination,,,,,
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.,,,,,
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication,,,,,
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to,,,,,
# ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data,,,,,
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,,,,,
# GML should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.,,,,,
# If the GML data are essential to the work, or if an important,,,,
# result or conclusion depends on the GML data, co-authorship,,,,
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in,,,,,
# the work.  Manuscripts using the GML data should be sent to GML,,,,,
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can,,,,,
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately,,,,,
# represented.,,,,,

# RECIPROCITY,,,,,
#,,,,,
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.,,,,,
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their,,,,,
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific,,,,,
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.,,,,,
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,,,,,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation,,,,
# of the GML data, namely well documented model code, transport,,,
# fields, and additional information necessary for other,,,,
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.,,,,,
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new,,,,,
# users of the models.,,,,,

# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling,,,,,
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the,,,,,
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).,,,,,
#,,,,,
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation,,,,,
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by,,,,,
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.,,,,,
#,,,,,
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same,,,,
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.,,,,,
